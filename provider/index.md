Hi there! My name is Viktor Kleen. I'm currently a PhD student in Mathematics at
USC in Los Angeles. My research interests include:

* $\AA^1$-homotopy theory
* Higher category theory
* Algebraic geometry

This site is supposed to serve as a research notebook to get me to write up
ideas and results. As such, it is woefully unpolished, unreliable and generally
to be used at your own risk.

Still, have fun! And please send email with suggestions, corrections,
criticism or general rants to <kleen@usc.edu> if you like.
