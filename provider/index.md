Hi there! My name is Viktor Kleen. I'm currently a PhD candidate in Mathematics
at USC in Los Angeles, see my [CV](./cv.pdf). My research interests include:

* $\AA^1$-homotopy theory
* Higher category theory
* Algebraic geometry

I now have a [preprint](./splitting-bgln.pdf) describing my work on a motivic
version of Snaith's stable splitting results.

This site is supposed to serve as a research notebook to get me to write up
ideas and results. As such, it is woefully unpolished, unreliable and generally
to be used at your own risk.

Still, have fun! And please send email with suggestions, corrections,
criticism or general rants to <kleen@usc.edu> if you like.
