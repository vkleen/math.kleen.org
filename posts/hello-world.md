% Hello, World!

This is the inaugural post for this site. This "blog" is supposed to become
populated by a variety of posts pertaining to my research at USC, to personal
projects and (mathematician's look away) its own architecture.

At the moment, I don't have much content; but hopefully this will change in due
time. In the first few posts, I think I will describe the custom software that I
put together to make this website happen; mostly for my benefit, so I have
documentation to fall back on once things break.

This is all I have to say right now. Carry on!
